### What is "everything"?

"Everything" is a Github project where you can change what you want, send your Pull Requests and they will be accepted on the repository.

*Nothing is True. Everything is permitted.*

### What can I do?

Everything!

### What cannot?

Nothing! Ok, be serious now. Only send something that is not a part of another project or illegal content or content that is not yours. Neither kittens! Otherwise, everything is permitted!

### Why should I welcome you, Gandalf the storm crow?
