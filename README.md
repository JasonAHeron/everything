### What is "everything"?

"Everything" is a Github project where you can change what you want, send your Pull Requests and they will be accepted on the repository.

*Nothing is True. Everything is permitted.*

### What can I do?

Everything!

### What cannot?

Nothing! Ok, being serious now. Don't send something that is part of another project or illegal content or content that is not of your authorship. Neither kittens! Otherwise, everything is permitted!

### Why should I welcome you, Gandalf the storm crow?
